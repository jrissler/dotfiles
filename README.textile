These are my personal dotfiles. This repo was inspired by "a post from Err the Blog":http://errtheblog.com/posts/89-huba-huba

h2. Mobile Dotfile

I've got a "mobile_dotfile gist":http://gist.github.com/90574 set up with some aliases I like to use on remoter servers.

<pre>
curl http://gist.github.com/raw/90574/ccea82b7b9999a63ba3d2e90fdb15690b4658e11/mobile_dotfile >> ~/.bashrc
